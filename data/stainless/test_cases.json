    "sublist": "Use the stainless framework to write verifiable scala code for a function that takes two scala List objects and returns whether the first list is a sublist of the second one. The first list is a sublist of the second list, if all elements of the first list appear in the second in the same order. For example, {0, 2} is a sublist of {0, 1, 2}, but {0, 0, 2} is not a sublist of {0, 2}. It should be verified that the function satisfies reflexivity and transitivity. Only output the code, such that your response is a valid scala program.",
    "fibonacci": "Use the stainless framework to write verifiable scala code for a function that takes a BigInt n and returns the n-th Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1. It should be verified that the response is correct and that every 3rd Fibonacci number is even. Only output the code, such that your response is a valid scala program.",
    "factorial": "Use the stainless framework to write verifiable scala code for a function that takes a BigInt n and returns the factorial of n. The factorial of n is defined as n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1. It should be verified that the response is correct and that the factorial of n is always larger or equal to n. Only output the code, such that your response is a valid scala program."
