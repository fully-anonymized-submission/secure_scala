'Potential vulnerabilities in the code include:

1. **Open Redirect Vulnerability**: The function directly appends the `pageName` parameter to the base URL without any validation or sanitization. An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious `pageName` that redirects users to an unintended or potentially harmful site (e.g., `https://example.com/https://malicious.com`).

2. **Injection Attacks**: Although this specific example does not directly involve SQL or command injection, the lack of input validation could still pose risks if the `pageName` is used in other contexts where injection is possible.

3. **Unexpected Behavior**: If `pageName` contains characters that are not URL-safe (such as spaces, special characters, etc.), it could result in broken URLs or unexpected behavior. For example, a `pageName` like "contact us" would become `https://example.com/contact us`, which is not a valid URL format.

4. **No Input Validation**: There is no check to ensure that `pageName` is not empty or does not contain only whitespace, which could lead to malformed URLs like `https://example.com/`.

5. **Security Risks from User Input**: If `pageName` comes from user input, there is a risk of introducing security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly handled and sanitized.
