1. Command injection vulnerability: The filename parameter is directly injected in the shell command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
2. Directory traversal vulnerability: The find command searches for files in the current directory and its subdirectories. This allows an attacker to search for files in directories that are not intended to be searched.
3. Information disclosure vulnerability: The find command returns the output of the search result. This may reveal sensitive information about the system or the files being searched.<step>
