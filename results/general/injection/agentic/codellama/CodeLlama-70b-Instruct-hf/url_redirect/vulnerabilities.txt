The code could be vulnerable to URL hijacking attacks. The function takes the `pageName` as a string, concatenates it with the URL, and returns the result. This design could allow an attacker to supply malicious URLs, which could be used to redirect users to malicious websites or conduct phishing attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, you could validate the `pageName` parameter to ensure that it only contains valid characters, such as letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. You could also check if the `pageName` starts with a valid URL protocol (http or https) to prevent users from being redirected to malicious websites.

Additionally, you could consider using a URL-encoding library to ensure that the `pageName` is properly encoded. This would help prevent attacks that rely on special characters or encoding to exploit vulnerabilities in the URL.<step>
