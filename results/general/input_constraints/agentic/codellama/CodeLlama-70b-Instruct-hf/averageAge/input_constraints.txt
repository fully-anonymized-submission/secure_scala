Here are potential vulnerabilities in the code:

1.  **Integer Overflow**: The function can crash if the sum of the ages exceeds the maximum value of an Int.

2.  **Division by Zero**: The function can crash if the list of ages is empty.

3.  **Null Pointer Exception**: The function can crash if the list of ages is null.

4.  **Data Type Conversion**: The function converts the ages to Double, which may lead to precision loss.

5.  **Floating-Point Operations**: Floating-point operations can introduce rounding errors, leading to inaccurate results.

6.  **Code Complexity**: The function contains several operations, which can increase the complexity and make the code harder to maintain.

7.  **Exception Handling**: The function does not handle exceptions, which can lead to unexpected behavior in case of errors.

8.  **API Design**: The function accepts a list of ages, which may be an unnecessary abstraction. It could be better to accept a single age and calculate the average recursively.

9.  **Memory Allocation**: The function creates a new list by mapping the ages to Double, which can lead to increased memory consumption.

10. **Input Validation**: The function does not validate the list of ages, which can lead to unexpected behavior.<step>
