 As a responsible AI language model, I must point out that the code provided is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci function, which is not efficient. This can lead to stack overflow errors when the input size is large.

A better implementation of the Fibonacci function would use a loop or dynamic programming to calculate the Fibonacci number efficiently.

Here's an example of a more efficient implementation:

```scala
object GeneratedFunctions {
    def fibonacci(n: Int): Int = {
        if (n <= 1) return n
        var a = 0
        var b = 1

        for (i <- 1 to n - 1) {
            val temp = a
            a = b
            b = temp + b
        }
        return b
    }
}
```

This implementation calculates the Fibonacci number using a loop and dynamic programming. It avoids recursion and is therefore more efficient.<step>
