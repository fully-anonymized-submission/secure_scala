The provided code is a tail-recursive function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number, which is the most efficient way to implement this function without causing a stack overflow.

However, there are some potential vulnerabilities in the code:

1. Overflow: The result of the Fibonacci sequence can be very large for large values of n, and it can cause an overflow if the result is stored in an integer type with limited capacity.
2. Negative Input: The function does not handle negative input values. If a negative number is passed, the function will still attempt to calculate the Fibonacci number, which might result in unexpected behavior.
3. Type Mismatch: The function signature indicates that it returns an Int, but the result of the Fibonacci sequence can be very large for large values of n. This might cause an overflow if the result is stored in an Int type.

To handle these potential issues:

1. For large values of n, you might want to use a type that can handle large numbers, such as BigInt.
2. Add a check at the beginning of the function to return 0 when n is less than 0.
3. Consider using a more efficient algorithm for large values of n, such as the matrix exponentiation method.
