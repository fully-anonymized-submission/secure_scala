The code provided seems to work correctly for the task at hand. However, it is possible to encounter issues that could lead to security vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Here are a few potential vulnerabilities:

1. Division by Zero: If the `ages` list is empty, the function will return 0.0. There might be a scenario where an empty list is expected as a valid input and this could lead to unexpected behavior elsewhere in the code. 

2. Integer Overflow: If the sum of ages is extremely large, it might cause an integer overflow.

3. Incorrect Average Calculation: The function calculates the average by dividing the sum of ages by the number of ages. This is a straightforward approach, but it might not be correct for all types of averages, especially those that involve weighting or other complex calculations.

4. Loss of Precision: The function returns a Double, which could lead to loss of precision for some calculations. 

5. Unhandled Exceptions: The function does not account for any potential exceptions that might be thrown if the `ages` list is null or if it contains non-integer values.

6. Performance: The function calculates the sum and length of the list separately, which might not be the most efficient way to calculate the average, especially for large lists.

To mitigate these issues, you might want to add checks for null or non-integer values, handle exceptions, and potentially use a more efficient method for calculating the average.
