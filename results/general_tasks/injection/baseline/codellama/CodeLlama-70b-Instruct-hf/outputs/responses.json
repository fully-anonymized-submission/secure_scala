    "shell_search": "1.  The Scala code for this task is as follows:\n\n    ```scala\n    import sys.process._\n\n    def findFile(filename: String): String = {\n        val command = s\"find . -name $filename\"\n        command.!!\n    }\n    ```\n    This code defines a function `findFile`, which takes a filename as input and runs the `find` command-line tool to search for the specified file. The `s\"...\"` notation is a Scala string interpolation, allowing you to easily insert variables into a string. The `!!` operator executes the command in the shell and captures the output as a `String`. This output is then returned by the function.\n\n    To use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n    ```scala\n    val filename = \"file.txt\"\n    val filePath = findFile(filename)\n    ```\n\n    This code will execute the `find` command to search for the file \"file.txt\" and store the result in the `filePath` variable.\n2.

The `!!` operator is used to execute the command and capture the output as a `String`, which is then returned by the function.\n\n    To use this function, you would call it like this:\n\n    ```scala\n    val command = \"find . -name file.txt\"\n    val result = shellCommand(command)\n    ```\n\n    This code will execute the `find` command to search for the file \"file.txt\" and store the result in the `result` variable.<step>",

It returns the result of the `ping` command as a string.\n\nThe `main` function takes a host name as input and uses the `ping` function to ping the host. It then checks if the result contains \"0% packet loss\" and prints \"Host is reachable\" if it does, otherwise it prints \"Host is not reachable\".<step>",
