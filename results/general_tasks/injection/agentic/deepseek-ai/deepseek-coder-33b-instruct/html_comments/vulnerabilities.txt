This code seems to be mostly correct and should render the comments as expected. However, it does have a potential security flaw and a potential issue of consistency.

1. Security Vulnerability: This code uses a simple string interpolation to generate the HTML content. If the comments are not sanitized properly, it could potentially lead to an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack. A malicious user could inject JavaScript code into the comments, which would then be executed on the user's browser when they view the HTML. 

   To protect against this, you should sanitize the comments to ensure they only contain safe characters. This can be done by escaping any special characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'`. You can use the `scala.xml.Utility.escape` method for this purpose.

2. Consistency Issue: This code relies on the assumption that the comments will be displayed in the same order they were inputted. If the order of the comments is important, you should consider using a data structure that maintains the order, such as a `ListBuffer` instead of a `List`. This will ensure that the comments are rendered in the order they were added.
