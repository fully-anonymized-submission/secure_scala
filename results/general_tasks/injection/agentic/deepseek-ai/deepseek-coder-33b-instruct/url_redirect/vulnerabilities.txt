This code is pretty straightforward and does not seem to have any obvious vulnerabilities. However, it does not validate or sanitize the input 'pageName'. This could potentially lead to security issues if 'pageName' is user-supplied and not properly validated or sanitized. For example, if an attacker can inject special characters into 'pageName', they could potentially execute code injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. 

Another potential vulnerability is that this code does not handle the case where 'pageName' is null or empty. If this function is called with null or empty 'pageName', it will throw a NullPointerException or an exception when trying to concatenate 'pageName' with the URL string.

That being said, without knowing more about the context, it's hard to be certain that this code is safe. 

It would be best to include some validation and sanitization for 'pageName' to prevent any potential security issues. You could use a regular expression to ensure 'pageName' only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores, for example.

Remember to handle the case where 'pageName' is null or empty, and also sanitize 'pageName' to prevent any potential code injection attacks or XSS attacks.
