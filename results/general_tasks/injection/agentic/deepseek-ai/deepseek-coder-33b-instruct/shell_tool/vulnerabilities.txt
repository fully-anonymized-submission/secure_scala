The code provided uses `ping -c 1 $host` to ping a host. This command is susceptible to shell injection attacks. An attacker could provide a host argument that includes additional commands, potentially leading to unauthorized command execution.

Here's an example of such an attack:

```scala
pingHost("www.example.com ; rm -rf /")
```

In this case, the command that gets executed is `ping -c 1 www.example.com ; rm -rf /`, which will delete all files in the root directory.

To prevent this, you should sanitize and validate any user input before using it in a shell command. You can use regex to ensure the hostname is valid and doesn't contain any malicious characters.

Furthermore, if the hostname is user input, it should be validated even before it is used in the `ping` command. The hostname should be checked to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters, dots, and dashes, and it should not contain any whitespace or special characters.
