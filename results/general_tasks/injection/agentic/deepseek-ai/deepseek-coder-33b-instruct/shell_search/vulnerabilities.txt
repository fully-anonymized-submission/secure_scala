The given code is susceptible to several vulnerabilities:

1. **Command Injection**: The `findFile` function directly uses the user input `filename` to construct a shell command without any sanitization or validation. This can lead to command injection attacks where an attacker can manipulate the `filename` argument to execute arbitrary commands on the system. For example, if the `filename` is set to `"*.txt; rm -rf /"`, the command would delete all files in the root directory.

2. **File Traversal**: The command `find / -name $filename` will search for the file recursively from the root directory `/`. This could potentially allow an attacker to find sensitive files that they normally wouldn't have access to.

3. **Unsanitized User Input**: The `filename` parameter is not sanitized or validated. This can lead to XSS or similar attacks if the input is not properly sanitized.

4. **Resource Exhaustion**: The `find` command can consume significant system resources if the file is not found or if the root directory contains a large number of files.

5. **Execution of Arbitrary Commands**: The `find` command can be used with `-exec` option to execute arbitrary commands on the found files. This can lead to code execution vulnerabilities.

To mitigate these issues, the `find` command should be used with proper sanitization and validation of the input. Also, the `-exec` option should not be used unless it's necessary.

Remember, it's crucial to always consider security when writing code, even if you're not directly handling sensitive data.
