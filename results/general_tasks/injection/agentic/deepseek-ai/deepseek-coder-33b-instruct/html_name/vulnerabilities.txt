The potential vulnerabilities in the code could be:

1. Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The generated HTML string is directly created from user input without any sanitization. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the HTML, which could be executed when the HTML is rendered.

2. Injection Vulnerabilities: The code is directly inserting the user's input into the HTML string, which could create potential injection vulnerabilities if the user input is not properly sanitized or controlled.

3. Data Leakage: The code is returning HTML content as a string. If this string is logged or sent to another system, it could potentially expose sensitive data.

4. Unescaped User Input: The code is directly injecting the user's name into the HTML string, which could open up the possibility of an injection attack if the user input is not properly escaped.

To mitigate these risks, it's important to sanitize any user input and escape any special characters that could be interpreted as HTML code. You might also want to consider using a templating engine or HTML generating library to ensure that user input is properly sanitized.
