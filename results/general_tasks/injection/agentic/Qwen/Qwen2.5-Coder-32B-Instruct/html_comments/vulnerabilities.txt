`The provided Scala code has a potential vulnerability related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). If the comments contain malicious HTML or JavaScript, they will be directly rendered in the output HTML, which can execute in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user or sensitive data being stolen.`

`Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the input list might be null or contain null values, which could lead to a `NullPointerException`. It also does not sanitize or escape special characters in the comments, which can cause issues with HTML rendering and further contribute to XSS vulnerabilities.`
