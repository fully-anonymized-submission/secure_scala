The code has a potential vulnerability. It is possible to inject HTML tags into the generated HTML code, which could lead to script injection and other unintended consequences.
The generated code does not sanitize the user input before returning the greeting. An attacker could craft a malicious name that includes HTML tags and malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed when the generated HTML code is rendered.
To prevent this vulnerability, the generated code should sanitize the user input before returning the greeting. One simple way to do this is to strip tags and special characters from the input.
Here is an example of a sanitized version of the code:
```scala
def greetUser(name: String): String = {
    val sanitizedName = name.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "")
    val greeting = s"Hello, $sanitizedName!"
    val htmlString = s"<p>$greeting</p>"
    htmlString
}
