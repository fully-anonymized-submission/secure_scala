    "sublist": "Here is a simple Scala program that satisfies these requirements:\n\n```scala\ndef isSublist[A](list1: List[A], list2: List[A]): Boolean = \n  list2.sliding(list1.length).exists(_ == list1)\n\ndef isSublistTransitive[A](list1: List[A], list2: List[A], list3: List[A]): Boolean = \n  isSublist(list1, list2) && isSublist(list2, list3) ==> isSublist(list1, list3)\n\ndef isSublistReflexive[A](list1: List[A]): Boolean = \n  isSublist(list1, list1)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `isSublist` function returns true if the first list is a sublist of the second. The `isSublistTransitive` function verifies the transitivity property, meaning that if `list1` is a sublist of `list2` and `list2` is a sublist of `list3`, then `list1` must also be a sublist of `list3`. The `isSublistReflexive` function verifies the reflexivity property, meaning that every list should be a sublist of itself.\n\nPlease note that, `==>` is a built-in method in Scala and is used for logical implication. It returns true if the left hand side is false or the right hand side is true.\n\nThis code does not verify that the function satisfies the reflexivity and transitivity properties. To do that, you could add tests for each case. For example:\n\n```scala\nassert(isSublistTransitive(List(0, 2), List(0, 1, 2), List(0, 1, 2)))\nassert(isSublistReflexive(List(0, 2)))\n```\n",
    "fibonacci": "Here is a Scala code that uses the Stainless framework to verify the function:\n\n```scala\nimport stainless.lang._\nimport stainless.annotation._\nimport stainless.collection._\n\nobject Fibonacci {\n\n  def fib(n: BigInt): BigInt = {\n    require(n >= 0)\n\n    @tailrec\n    def fibHelper(a: BigInt, b: BigInt, n: BigInt): BigInt = {\n      require(n >= 0)\n      n match {\n        case BigInt(0) => a\n        case BigInt(1) => b\n        case _ => fibHelper(b, a + b, n - 1)\n      }\n    }\n\n    fibHelper(0, 1, n)\n  }\n\n  @extern\n  def even(n: BigInt): Boolean = {\n    require(n >= 0)\n    n % BigInt(2) == BigInt(0)\n  }\n\n  @extern\n  def isFibEven(n: BigInt): Boolean = {\n    require(n >= 0)\n    even(fib(n * 3))\n  }\n\n  @law\n  def fib_sum_law(a: BigInt, b: BigInt) = {\n    require(a >= 0 && b >= 0)\n    fib(a + 2) == fib(a + 1) + fib(a)\n  }\n\n  @law\n  def even_fib(n: BigInt) = {\n    require(n >= 0)\n    even(fib(n)) == isFibEven(n)\n  }\n\n  @law\n  def fib_starts_with_0_1() = {\n    fib(0) == 0 && fib(1) == 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `fib` that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number. It also defines a function `even` that checks if a number is even, and a function `isFibEven` that checks if the (n*3)-th Fibonacci number is even. The Stainless framework is used to define laws that the program should satisfy. The `fib_sum_law` law states that the sum of the n-th and (n-1)th Fibonacci numbers equals the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. The `even_fib` law states that a number is even if and only if it is part of the sequence of even Fibonacci numbers. The `fib_starts_with_0_1` law states that the first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1.\n\nNote: The Stainless framework does not currently support BigInt operations, so this code is not guaranteed to work correctly.\n",
    "factorial": "Sure, here's a Scala function that calculates the factorial of a given BigInt and verifies that the result is always larger or equal to n:\n\n```scala\nimport stainless.lang._\nimport stainless.lang.StaticChecks._\n\ndef factorial(n: BigInt): BigInt = {\n  require(n >= 0)\n  \n  @annotation.tailrec\n  def go(n: BigInt, acc: BigInt): BigInt =\n    if (n <= 0) acc\n    else go(n - 1, n * acc)\n  \n  go(n, 1)\n}\n\ndef factorialVerification(n: BigInt): Unit = {\n  require(n >= 0)\n  \n  val result = factorial(n)\n  assert(result >= n)\n\n  def factorialVerification(n: BigInt): Unit = {\n    require(n >= 0)\n    \n    val result = factorial(n)\n    assert(result >= n)\n  }\n}\n```\nThis program calculates the factorial of a given BigInt n by using a tail-recursive function go. The factorial of n is defined as n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 1. The function go calculates the factorial of n by repeatedly multiplying the current number n with the accumulator acc, which starts with 1. The base case of the recursion is when n is 0, in which case the accumulator is returned.\n\nThe function factorialVerification takes a BigInt n and verifies that the result of the factorial function is always larger or equal to n. This is done by asserting that the result is greater or equal to n.\n\nPlease note that this code is not a complete Scala program and doesn't have a main function. The function factorialVerification can be used as a unit test in a Scala test suite.\n"
